# Trek Techno Babble
WordPress plugin to generate Star Trek-style techno-babble. This is not just a plugin, it symbolizes the hope and enthusiasm of an entire generation summed up in two words - Star Trek.

This plugin, similar to Matt Mullenweg's own Hello Dolly, will add a random line to the top of your administration page. But, instead of a line from a song from a barely remembered musical, this will be an item of randomly generated Star Trek-style techno babble, with possibly millions of different combinations possible.

Yes, you too can create some really impressive, scientifically baseless (yet still entertaining) techno-babble. It's useless! It's fun! It's free! It's not official endorsed by Paramount!

## To Use
Upload, activate and watch in joy as a random piece of totally pointless techno-babble appears at the top of your dashboard screens.

## History

Originally titled "Hello Babble", this plugin has a long history. Indeed, it's older than the plugin itself.

My first job, in 1989, was as a mainframe developer and I ended up writing (unoffically) a fun piece of code that randomly generated techno-babble. Where I got the various phrases from, I don't know - that's been lost in the mists of time.

I've written it in various languages since and, in 2013, I published a WordPress plugin version of it to wordpress.org named "Hello Babble". I closed it in 2018 but [evidence of its existence still remains](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-babble/).

Now, I've dusted down the code, renamed it and brought up-to-date with the latest coding standards.
